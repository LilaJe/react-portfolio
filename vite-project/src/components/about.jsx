      <p>
        Hello! My name is Lila, and I am currently a full stack web development
        student at the University of Kansas. I am a lover of all things art,
        food, and travel. And when I say a lover of food, i mean LOVER OF FOOD,
        so watch out because I'm always snackin. I like to think of myself as
        witty, creative, quality-driven, and an overall outgoing person. I am
        always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow more as a
        person everyday. I am excited to continue this journey and see what the
        future holds.{" "}
